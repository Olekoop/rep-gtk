This is rep-gtk, a binding of GTK+ for the librep Lisp system. It is
based on Marius Vollmer's guile-gtk binding (initially version 0.15,
updated to 0.17), with a new glue-code generator.

For more details see:

	http://sawfish.wikia.com

Installation
============

Basically, `./configure ; make ; make install'. If you're building from
the git repository, use ./autogen.sh instead of ./configure.

It requires Gtk+ version 2.

Feedbacks
=========
Please report Bugs and all patches to the mailing list
<sawfish-list@gnome.org>.

When possible, please make patches in unified diff format 
(i.e. 'diff -u' or use 'git diff').

Usage
=====

Import the module gui.gtk-2.gtk to load the library, then call
functions as in guile-gtk. The only difference is that Lisp conventions
are used for booleans, i.e. nil for #f, and non-nil for #t.

See the included *.defs files for the details of how the library maps
to lisp functions. See also examples.

*** Don't test it from sawfish-client, but use the bare rep. Otherwise,
Sawfish will crash. ***

Caveats
=======

It's still too easy to crash the Lisp interpreter through invalid use
of GTK..
