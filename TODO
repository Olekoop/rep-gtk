TODO
====

 * merge in the .defs changes from guile-gtk 0.17

   [ I think I've got everything else, except some related functions
   added to gtk-support.c ]

 * fix the signal_connect_object stuff in libglade-support.c

 * support the `define-struct' and `define-ptype' defs

 * [sup]port the GNOME bindings
